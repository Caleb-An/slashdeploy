## FAQ

### What's GitHub Deployments?

In a nutshell, GitHub Deployments are a way to initialize a deployment **request** for a GitHub repository. It allows you to decouple the act of requesting a deployment, and the actual fullfillment. This allows you to have a consistent interface for performing deployments, whether it's a web app, infrastructure, native application, etc.

## Development
